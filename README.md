# **🩺💡 Disease Symptom Prediction 💡🩺**

## **🔍 Overview**
This project leverages **machine learning** to predict potential diseases based on input symptoms. By analyzing a dataset of symptoms and diseases, the model aims to assist in early detection and medical decision-making.

## **📂 Dataset**
The dataset comprises various **symptoms** linked to specific **diseases**. The data has been split into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets for model development.

## **🤖 Models Used**
Several **machine learning algorithms** were trained for disease prediction, achieving high accuracy. Below are the top-performing models:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 🌟 (best accuracy: **99.59%**)
- **Random Forest Classifier** 🌳 (accuracy: **99.39%**)
- **Decision Tree Classifier** 🌲 (accuracy: **99.39%**)
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** 🧠 (accuracy: **92.07%**)
- **Logistic Regression** 📉 (accuracy: **90.55%**)

### **🔧 Model Architecture**:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies based on the most similar data points in the dataset.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that increases prediction accuracy.
- **Decision Tree**: Builds a tree structure where decisions are made based on the features.
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Finds the hyperplane that best separates classes (diseases).
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model used for disease classification.

### **⚙️ Data Preprocessing**:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies and handled missing data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Converted symptoms into suitable formats for machine learning models.

## **📊 Results**
The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model achieved the highest accuracy of **99.59%**, closely followed by **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree Classifier**, both at **99.39%**.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: 99.59% 🌟
- **Random Forest**: 99.39% 🌳
- **Decision Tree**: 99.39% 🌲
- **Support Vector Classifier**: 92.07% 🧠
